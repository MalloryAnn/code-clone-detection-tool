# Code Clone Detection Tool

# Description
The Code Clone Detection Tool is designed to identify and eliminate duplicate or similar code segments in Python and Java projects. It supports three types of clones:

Type 1: Exact matches of code.                          
Type 2: Renamed variables but structurally identical code.                    
Type 3: Modified code with retained structural similarities.

This tool provides a user-friendly interface to detect clones, generate reports, and help developers refactor redundant code. The tool can handle large codebases efficiently and is built to support a wide range of projects.

# Features
Clone Detection: Identifies Type 1, 2, and 3 code clones in Python and Java.        
GUI Interface: Provides a simple graphical interface to navigate through the code clones.
Refactoring Suggestions: Helps developers refactor duplicate code.                  
Clone Reports: Generates detailed reports of detected clones.
